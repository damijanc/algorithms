Sometimes you want to sort values in i.e. array. Of course you ca use bubble, merge ... sort algorithm. But what if you know your set of values (the key)? Than you can define a hash table (associative array) of predefined values in the order that you require. This solution will reduce the number of operations to N+K where N is number of elements to sort and K is the key length
